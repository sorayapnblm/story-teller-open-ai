## Database Setup

This project uses MongoDB as the database for storing user data. To set up the database for this project, follow these steps:

1. **MongoDB Installation**: If you haven't already installed MongoDB, you can download it from the [official MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

2. **Configuration File**: In the "server" folder, locate the "index.js" file. Open this file and find the following line:

            mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/user-story-teller", {
                        useNewUrlParser: true,
                        useUnifiedTopology: true
            });

Replace "mongodb://localhost:27017/user-story-teller" with your own database.
